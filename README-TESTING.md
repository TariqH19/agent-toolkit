## 🔧 **Available PayPal Operations**

- `"Get details for order ORDER_ID"` → Retrieves order information
- `"Capture payment for order ORDER_ID"` → Attempts to capture payment

### **Invoice Operations**

- `"Create an invoice for client@example.com for $100"` → Creates real invoice
- `"List all my invoices"` → Shows all invoices
- `"Get details for invoice INVOICE_ID"` → Retrieves invoice info

### **Other Operations**

- `"Create a shipment tracking for TRACKING_NUMBER"` → Shipment tracking
- `"What PayPal tools are available?"` → Lists all available tools

## 🎯 **How to Capture/Complete Orders**

### **Understanding Order Status**

When you create an order, it has status `PAYER_ACTION_REQUIRED`. This means:

1. The order is created in PayPal sandbox
2. A buyer needs to approve/pay for it
3. Only then can it be captured

### **To Complete an Order in Sandbox:**

1. **Create Order**: `"Create an order for $50"`
2. **Get Order Details**: `"Get details for order YOUR_ORDER_ID"`
3. **Use Approval URL**: The order details include a link like:
   ```
   https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/checkoutnow?token=YOUR_ORDER_ID
   ```
4. **Simulate Payment**: Use PayPal's test buyer accounts to complete payment
5. **Capture Order**: `"Capture payment for order YOUR_ORDER_ID"`

### **PayPal Sandbox Test Accounts**

- Log into [PayPal Developer Dashboard](https://developer.paypal.com/developer/accounts/)
- Use test buyer accounts to simulate payments
- Complete the payment flow before attempting capture
