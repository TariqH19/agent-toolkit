## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Server Not Running**

```javascript
console.log("üîç Debug:", response);
```

## üìù Test Results Interpretation

### Feature Test Results

- **Successful Operations**: Look for invoice IDs and success messages
- **Failed Operations**: Check error messages for PayPal API issues
- **Partial Success**: Operations that complete but with warnings

### Workflow Test Results

- **Complete Workflows**: All steps in sequence successful
- **Partial Workflows**: Some steps succeed, others fail
- **Failed Workflows**: Critical errors prevent completion

### Function Test Results

- **Per-Function Success Rate**: Percentage of tests passing per function
- **Overall Success Rate**: Total tests passing across all functions
- **Error Patterns**: Common failure types across functions

## üîÑ Integration with Existing Tests

These new invoice tests are designed to **complement** your existing test suite:

- **Preserves**: Your current `test-comprehensive.js` and `test-new-features.js`

3. **Configure PayPal**: Ensure sandbox credentials are properly set
4. **Customize Tests**: Modify test data and scenarios as needed
5. **Monitor**: Use for ongoing validation of invoice functionality

## üéØ Testing Best Practices

1. **Run in Sequence**: Don't run multiple test suites simultaneously
